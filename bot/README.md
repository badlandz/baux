# Hi I'm BAUX BOT!

I'm here to help keep BAUX fun and productive, try me out!

Right now I'm just a script called baux-bot.sh in ~/src/baux/bot/ 
But someday I'll be a fully integrated pain in the BAUX!

Bot was written to use RAG and focus on README and ROADMAP
Still a script, not made pane or window, waiting to load RAG and models

Thoughts: Probably should be "openable" as mapped key for "bot" 
what is the best workflow, alt-b for bot, alt-something, alt? 

Where is my tmux now... I'm alt-hjkl for switching windows so:
* alt-1 to alt-9 can be windows like opt-1to9 are for dwm
* alt-b for bot? What's "b" normally
* dwm logic, opt-b is the status bar hide... and control-b does nothing
* the "bot" could be "help" but h belongs to vim, and ? requires "shift"
* SHIFT should be bot to "window" and "b" is pane:
* FINAL?
  * ALT-b = new pane in current window with new instance of bot
  * ALT-B (upper case, shift-b) = new WINDOW in session with just the bot
```

# FORKED FROM Omarchy

## Omarchy, The Parent Source Installer for Arch

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system based on Hyprland by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omarchy (like it was for Omakub). No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omarchy is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.

Legacy thinking of myown on a more updated UI?

Need to get my neovim setup into this, instead of lazyvim, and, and, and, and, and refine that project:
* Business/Legal writing in neovim
* latex processing documents output to court
* email/api automation
* matrix?
* resolution problems (bad eyeight, phone versions?)
* 


dump thoughts...:

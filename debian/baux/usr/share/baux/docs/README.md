# BAUX – Badlandz Auxiliary UniX

A distributed terminal IDE and shell replacement for embedded electronics.

Boot → tmux → Neovim → Gruvbox → instant workflow for Arduino, ESP32, Pi Zero, sensors, relays, OLEDs.

This is the single source of truth for both the BAUX package and RoxieOS micro-distro.

- core/      → shipped files
- nvim/      → Neovim config
- roxieos/   → distro rebranding & live-ISO builder
- forge/     → deb/ISO build system
- demo/      → real-world electronics workflows
- legacy/    → gutted history from coyoteUI, bashrc, etc.

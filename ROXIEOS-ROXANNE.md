# ROXIEOS 


RoxieOS's first release will be roxanne.

RoxieOS will track Debian, roxanne will track trixie

## Minimal Distro:

The roxanne 0.1 will be the **Rick-Roll v0.1** 

The plan is to make it a version that will make people stop scrolling and say “what the actual fuck is this and why do I need it right now”.

Everything “practical” can come in v0.2 (“Stealth Edition” — black theme, no GRUB joke, normal kernel).

But v0.1 has to be the **red radioactive middle finger to every bloated distro**.

It’s not “overdoing it for a text editor”.

It’s the **distro equivalent of a glitter bomb**.

# BAUX • RoxieOS  
### Terminal-Native Distributed Development Environment for Embedded Systems

***WARNING***
 BAUX is meant for dedicated hardware. It will break your existing system and overwrite required critical data.
 BAUX itself is not yet stable, and a work in progress. HIGH RISK damage to data and hardware is not only possible, but likely at this state.

**BAUX** is a next-generation, terminal-native development environment designed for **embedded systems**, **remote hardware debugging**, and **multi-host SSH workflows**—built to run smoothly even on a **Raspberry Pi Zero**.

It provides a **persistent, distributed, session-aware interface** that merges:

- **Neovim** (IDE, UI, scripting engine)  
- **tmux** (process/session multiplexer)  
- **Lua** (BAUX’s configuration & automation language)  

…into a unified environment that behaves like a **terminal-based distributed operating system**.

**RoxieOS** is a micro-Debian distribution optimized for BAUX.

Together, they form a cohesive ecosystem for hardware-focused developers.

# 1. What Is BAUX?

### **BAUX is a Terminal-Based Distributed Multiplexing IDE**

A tighter definition:

> **BAUX is a host-aware, persistent, auto-reconnecting, Neovim-powered shell environment built on top of tmux, designed to orchestrate development workflows across many devices simultaneously.**

Think of BAUX as a highly opinionated session multiplexer, a "meta-OS for terminal life," a "non-X, non-Wayland" way of life, "the Omarchy of life in a shell."

The emphasis is on **distributed session management**:

- Each host (local or remote) has its own BAUX “layout”
- tmux layouts auto-load and auto-save
- SSH panes reconnect automatically
- No nested tmux issues (per-host namespaces)
- Neovim acts as the main UI framework
- The entire environment survives:
  - network drop  
  - power loss  
  - device crash  
  - laptop sleep/roam  

BAUX is **cross-platform**  
(Linux, macOS, BSD, containers, Raspberry Pi, servers).

It is designed especially for **embedded developers** working with:

- microcontrollers  
- SBCs  
- robotics  
- sensors  
- 3D printers  
- field-deployed data collection units

# 2. Why BAUX Exists

Embedded + distributed development today is built on **fragile glue**:

- SSH sessions that get disconnected  
- tmux sessions that get nested  
- ad-hoc Neovim configs lacking workflow cohesion  
- separate terminals for build servers, microcontrollers, logs, and SQL DBs  
- remote/field hardware waking up and going offline unpredictably  

BAUX consolidates all these scattered pieces into a **single structured environment**.

### BAUX solves four critical problems:

#### **1. Persistent, Distributed Workflows**
Automatically reconnect SSH panes and restore all session state—even across multiple hosts.

#### **2. A True IDE Inside the Terminal**
Neovim handles:
- LSP
- debugging (DAP)
- file navigation
- serial monitors
- hardware dashboards
- build & upload workflows

#### **3. Runs on the Slowest Hardware**
The **Raspberry Pi Zero (non-W)** is the target baseline.

#### **4. Reproducibility**
Containers and Debian packages ensure identical environments everywhere.

# 3. The BAUX Ecosystem

There are **two tightly-related projects**:

---

## BAUX  
### The Shell Environment & Core Technology  
(Primary focus of v0.1)

Features:

- **Neovim-based UI** (Lua-driven)
- **tmux layout engine**
- **distributed session manager**
- **per-host layout namespaces**
- **auto-reconnect SSH integration**
- **static builds** for Pi Zero
- **minimal plugin set** for low memory systems

BAUX is the heart of the system.

---

## RoxieOS  
### Micro-Debian Distribution Optimized for BAUX

RoxieOS is a **Debian Trixie derivative** engineered for:

- Raspberry Pi Zero compatibility:
  - Full heart of cyberdeck, OR
  - headless, OR 
  - "only a head" (no keyboard/mouse)
- terminal-only operation (no X11, no Wayland)  
- ultra-minimal default footprint  
- reproducible builds (containers 901/902)  
- clean BAUX integration  

RoxieOS remains **fully Debian-compatible**  
(for Arduino IDE, toolchains, 3D printing software, etc.).

First release: **“roxanne”** (tracking Debian Trixie).

---

# 4. BAUX v0.1 — Minimum Real Version (MVP)

To prevent scope explosion, v0.1 focuses on **BAUX itself**, with the essential distributed workflow foundation.

### ✔ MUST-HAVE Features

#### **1. Host-Aware Layout Engine**
- Detect current host (local vs remote)
- Load associated tmux layout
- Save state on exit
- Prevent nested tmux via host namespaces

#### **2. Auto-Reconnect SSH**
- Reopen dead SSH panes automatically
- Detect host offline/online state
- Recover pane names + commands

#### **3. Neovim as the Primary UI**
- Lua runtime
- Minimal plugins only
- LSP for:
  - Python  
  - Lua  
  - C  
- Fast startup (optimized init.lua)

#### **4. Pi Zero Compatible Static Build**
- One binary or set of minimal binaries
- Avoid large plugin footprints
- Memory usage suitable for 512MB RAM

#### **5. Simple Debian Installer Script**
Before RoxieOS is ready, BAUX should install on:
- Debian Trixie Lite
- Raspberry Pi OS Lite
- Ubuntu minimal

### ❌ Not Included in v0.1 (Delayed)
- PlatformIO integration  
- DAP debugging  
- Arduino Language Server  
- Full CoyoteUI inspired visual enhancements  
- SD card imaging UI  
- RoxieOS image builder  

These will come in future releases.

---

# 5. Example Workflow

A typical embedded developer may simultaneously:

- Edit firmware in Neovim  
- Cross-compile on a remote server  
- Upload code via Arduino CLI  
- Watch sensor logs on an OLED/1602A/SSD1306  
- Tail serial output  
- Query a SQL database  
- Monitor Pi Zero system metrics  

**BAUX binds all of these into a single persistent interface**, where each pane belongs to a different host and reliably reconnects.

Example layout (local host):

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Neovim (Firmware Code)                           |
+-----------------------+--------------------------+
| Remote build server   | Serial Monitor           |
| (SSH auto-reconnect)  | (Arduino/Pi target)      |
+-----------------------+--------------------------+
| SQL Console / Logs / Hardware Dashboards         |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

Laptop sleeps → network drops → Pi loses power →  
Reconnect → **BAUX restores the environment automatically**.

# 6. Embedded Development Tooling (Optional Modules)

Once BAUX core stabilizes, it will integrate:

### Arduino
- `arduino-cli`
- Arduino Language Server
- Telescope-based library discovery
- PlatformIO support (`nvim-platformio`)

### Languages
- Lua
- Python
- C/C++
- Arduino C
- SQL (SQLite/Postgres clients)
- Bash/sh

### Debugging / Monitoring
- Serial monitor integration
- nvim-dap (future)
- nvim-dap-ui (future)
- SD card imaging tools

# 7. Comparison to Similar Projects

| Category | Existing Tools | BAUX Difference |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Multiplexing | tmux, screen, zellij | BAUX builds a *session OS* on top of tmux |
| Remote Access | SSH, Mosh | BAUX auto-reconnects + restores state per host |
| Terminal IDE | Neovim configs | BAUX treats Neovim as core UI, not just an editor |
| Lightweight OS | Alpine, Tiny Core, DietPi | RoxieOS is Debian-compatible + BAUX-optimized |
| Dotfile Mgmt | home-manager, chezmoi | BAUX is not a dotfile loader; it is the environment itself |

No existing tool integrates *all* of these into a low-resource distributed workflow.

# 9. Name Origins

- **BAUX**  
  - “bash + UI”  
  - “Badlandx Alternative UniX”  
- **CoyoteUI**  (phasing out, this replaces that project)
  - the original messy, brilliant prototype  
- **RoxieOS**  
  - lean, lightweight, dependable  

Together they form a modern rethinking of terminal-based development environments.
